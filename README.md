 We will check the relationship between the number of children and the repayment of the loan on time by building a pivot table based on the values of the `children` and `debt` columns.  First, let's define what values they store in themselves. The `children` column has already been processed before, and we know that the number of children varies from 0 to 5. And `debt` at first glance has only 2 values and probably indicates whether the client has a debt or not.


## General conclusion
As part of the study of the reliability of bank borrowers, the influence of such indicators as the number of children of the client, marital status, income level and the purpose of the loan on the fact of closing the loan on time was determined.

When processing the input database from the bank, errors and missing values ​​were found and processed in the data on the number of children in the family, total work experience, age of clients and monthly income. Additional generalizing categories by income level and purpose of the loan have been added.

The analysis revealed a slight negative impact of the presence of children on the timely payment of debt on loans. Although there is not enough data on large families, nevertheless, with an increase in the number of children in a family, an increase in the delinquency rate is observed.

The semen status of the client also has little effect. So, people who have never been officially married before have a little more arrears on loans.

Additionally, the factor of loan repayment on time is influenced by the client's income level and the purpose of the loan, which must also be taken into account when building a credit scoring model.
